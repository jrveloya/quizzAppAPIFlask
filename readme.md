# Quiz API

#Update from 03/14/2025 @ 7:30 PM PST
I added the frontend for the project. There are multiple additions to the program:
1. Added a sign up function for teachers.
2. Added an add quiz page (not yet available, but accessible to only teachers)
3. Students can now join a quiz and answer questions with only the Quiz code.
4. DB will now store all quiz information including participants and questions
## Currently, I am working on:
1. Adding functionality to teacher side
2. Adding a teacher dashboard, displaying all quiz data and allowing them to create a new quiz
3. Login/logout function
4. Sign up page and routes
